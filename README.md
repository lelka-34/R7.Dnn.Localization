# About R7.DnnLocalization

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

*R7.DnnLocalization* is an almost complete russian translation of [DNN Plaftorm](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/).

Localization resources for DNN v8.0.4 located in `Core8` folder.

Localization resources for DNN v7.4.2 located in `Core7` folder.

Source files for DNNÂ v7.1.2 available in [dnn-712 branch](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization/tree/dnn-712).

## Install

Get the latest *Core* language pack from [releases](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization/releases),
then go to *DNN &gt; Host &gt; Extensions* and install like any other extension. After that, you should see *Russian*
language available to select in Admin &gt; Languages.

Language packs for *Blog*, *Forum* and *Feedback* modules and *CKEditor HTML editor provider* should be installed separately, 
the same way as for core one.

## Contribute

You could contribute your translations and fixes
via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/r7solutions) or directly via git pull requests.

## Customize

Though currently I don't have plans for translating *DNN* to any other language than *russian*, 
all helper scripts are configurable and customizable.

Feel free to extend the project by providing localization for other cultures! 

The easiest way to start is to request new translation language for one of 
DNN-related [Transifex projects](https://www.transifex.com/r7solutions/) 
and (optionally) fork *R7.DnnLocalization* project on GitHub. 
From that point we could work together to support new language.
