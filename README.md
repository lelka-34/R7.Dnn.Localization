# About R7.DnnLocalization

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

*R7.DnnLocalization* project goal is to provide complete *Russian* localization
of [DNN Plaftorm](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/) static resource files (the UI messages).

Currently localization is based on 7.1.2 version of *DNN Platform*, but it could be
used with more recent versions. Note that when I finally switch to the new version,
all 7.1.2-related stuff will remain in the separate git branch.

## Install

Get the latest resource pack from [releases](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization/releases),
go to *DNN &gt; Host &gt; Extensions and install*, like any other extension. After that, you should see *Russian*
language available to select in Admin &gt; Languages.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute your translations or fixes, it can be done via 
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/r7solutions) 
or directly via git pull requests.

## Customize

Though currently I not have plans to translate *DNN* to any other language than 
*russian*, all helper scripts are configurable and customizable.

Feel free to extend the project by providing localization for other cultures! 
The easiest way to start is to request new translation language for one of 
DNN-related [Transifex projects](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/r7-dnn-core/) 
and (optionally) fork *R7.DnnLocalization* project on GitHub. 
From that point we could work together to support new language.
