*R7.DnnLocalization* project goal is to provide complete *Russian* localization
for [DNN Plaftorm](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/).

Currently localization is based on 7.4.2 version of *DNN Platform*. 
Source files for 7.1.2 version of *DNN Platform* available in [dnn-712 branch](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization/tree/dnn-712).

## Install

Get the latest *Core* language pack from [releases](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization/releases),
then go to *DNN &gt; Host &gt; Extensions* and install like any other extension. After that, you should see *Russian*
language available to select in Admin &gt; Languages.

Translations for *Blog* and *Forum* modules and *CKEditor* provider should be installed separately, 
the same way as for core system.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute your translations or fixes, it can be done via 
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/r7solutions) 
or directly - via git pull requests.

## Customize

Though currently I don't have plans for translating *DNN* to any other language than *russian*, 
all helper scripts are configurable and customizable.

Feel free to extend the project by providing localization for other cultures! 
The easiest way to start is to request new translation language for one of 
DNN-related [Transifex projects](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/r7-dnn-core/) 
and (optionally) fork *R7.DnnLocalization* project on GitHub. 
From that point we could work together to support new language.
